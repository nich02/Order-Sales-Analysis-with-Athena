## Order-Sales-Analysis-with-Athena

In this project I place myself in the position of a Data Engineer with a responsibilities spanning different data professions like Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Analyst, Data Scientist ..
I took a time to develop business questions that management could be needing answers to. The data is customer data collected from a fictious company Nick'sGlo.Inc. As a data specialist, I wanted to harnes the internal data information for performance analysis. The analysis could help me understand what next? ‘what if?’ and ‘what’s out there?’ kind of questions.
